# RoChat

This repository holds the official source code for RoChat's new backend. Previously, the old backend was written in PHP. The newer one, coming soon, will be written in Rust, a blazingly fast language. The backend API will be heavily documented.



# Compiling

* Todo



# Notes

* Documentation can be found [here](https://docs.rohangames.tk)

* Work will begin after GCSEs are done (not straight away, however, I need a break!)

* Due to project restraints, which can be found on the documentation, there will be no estimated release date. 

* After everything is done (backend, frontend and testing) and released, the old one will be removed, being replaced with the new one.
  
  * The old one will **not** be archived because of how messy and awful it is actually is, plagued with bugs that could potentially have security issues.
